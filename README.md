# Voxify
Voxify is an open-source 3D modeler for voxel based models. It will incorporate very basic features such as color & shader manipulation, as well as a dopesheet and curves sheet for simple animation.

Voxify is programmed in C#, using Unity3D because I tried using SharpDX and I don't feel like deeling with matrices right now.

### Platforms

Mono.NET's System.Windows.Forms and System.Drawing wrappers are not compatible with Linux, unfortunately. Until we implement something like QT or GTK, Voxify will not be released of Linux and will only be built on OS X and Windows.
