# Voxify
Voxify is an open-source 3D modeler for voxel based models. It will incorporate very basic features such as color & shader manipulation, as well as a dopesheet and curves sheet for simple animation.

Voxify is programmed in C#, using Unity3D because I tried using SharpDX and I don't feel like deeling with matrices right now.

### Platforms

I will ensure that the code is compatible for builds across Linux, OS X and Windows. Thankfully, Unity handles most of that for me.
